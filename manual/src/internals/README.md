# Internals

This section of the manual deals with the inner workings of dcg. The
*algorithmic* details will not be given, as they are already described
at length in the paper (which you can find in the `theory/` folder of
the repository). Instead, this section will deal with how each command
works internally and how dcg repositories are structured.
